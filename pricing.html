                        <p>
                            When God entrusted us with this ministry, we were determined to follow the vision Jesus gave to His
                            Disciples to Go Out and make Disciples of all Nations. Our mission follows suit and is it our vision
                            to train students up for the Ministry of God and to validate them to go out and work as Christian
                            ministers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is our goal to help people receive the educational
                            recognition they need to fulfill their dreams of serving the Lord in the 5 Fold Ministry of God.
                            GCMR school is a God Ordained Christ Centred Faith Based Training Entity to train ministers up for
                            Pentecostal and Charismatic Christian Faith Based religions around the Globe via our accredited study
                            programs, being it class room teachings or online study programs, ranging from NQF level6 to NQF
                            Level 12 to take the True Gospel of Jesus Christ into every Country, City, Township or Village in
                            the World. It must be understand that the End Time Church will be in the air waves for the church as
                            we know it will be politically forbidden to conduct public services. It is fair to state that GCMR
                            school one of the fastest growing Christian Pentecostal and Charismatic Faith Base Academies across
                            the Globe.

                        <p>
                            For too long did the Trinity Doctrine Training Entities across the world forced Reborn
                            Christians to study at their training institutions. Ever since the Apartheid years and the Independence
                            of South Africa, Pentecostal and Charismatic churches were marginalized and made out to be a sect
                            movements, whereas in fact we are the only church organizations that are Biblically Correct.
                            Our goal is to teach the True Gospel of Jesus Christ that He bought so dearly with His blood on
                            Mount Calvary to all corners of the earth. One of our commissions is to train and validate the
                            lost sheep of Israel, the previous disadvantage and previous marginalized pastors and churches
                            after the manipulation by the previous SA governments.

                            The lower income bracket people in
                            South Africa Could not afford the high training costs of Public Universities. Whereas the previous
                            marginalized groups could not execute their Human Rights, Religious Rights and constitutional rights
                            to have freedom of choice when it comes to religious fait The government universities did not make
                            provision for the marginalized groups and hence people was forced to follow the governmental SAQA
                            SETAâ€™s as the only religious controlling authority and led to that Protestantism got camouflaged by
                            Catholic Doctrines. Luckily is it the policies of the new government to protect the rights of all
                            peoples, religions and religious groups. Origin and formation GCMR school has its linage from
                            GOD CHURCH MUST RISE MOVEMENT that was established in 2020 to unite God Church around south africa.
                            We made history when the GCMR school  was successfully lunched and registered as a Christian Faith
                            Based Training school  for Pentecostal and Charismatic Faith Based Christian leaders on the 19 June
                            2021 and registered as Private (PTY) Ltd Christian Theology Training Company
